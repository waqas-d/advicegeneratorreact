Waqas Dad

Peer review by: Jerrod Packard
Peer review comments: Your web app looks nice and it pulls the data down as it should. It is missing the button to refresh the component to generate new advice, however, as well as the line between the advice and the button. I couldn't figure those things out either. The text for the advice should be a lighter gray color and the text for the ADVICE # should be a bit smaller.
